File Organizer Script

A simple Python script that automatically organizes files in a given folder into categorized subfolders based on their file type. Each file is also renamed with a **timestamp** to prevent duplicates.

Perfect for keeping your **Downloads folder** or **work directories** clean and structured.

Features

* Automatically sorts files into categories (PDFs, Images, Word Docs, Excel, Code, Archives, etc.).
* Adds a **timestamp** to file names to prevent overwriting.
* Creates target folders on the fly if they donâ€™t exist.
* Catch-all **`Others`** folder for unknown file types.
* Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
